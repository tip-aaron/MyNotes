# MyNotes

An extremely lightweight and fast text editor that uses as little memory as possible.

## GOALS

- Initial prototype
    - [x] Basic Piece Table
    - [x] B-Tree for line indexing
    - [x] Opening a file from a path
    - [ ] Simple UI for opening file chooser
    - [ ] Cursor with selection in mind
    - [ ] Viewport with scrolling
    - [ ] Render opened text file onto viewport

## NOTES

For this current development iteration, this project
only aims to handle ASCII characters.

After having a MVP, it will move on to support UTF-8 characters.

Then, after that, new features and improvements to UI, etc.

P.S. This is an educational side project of mine. Some codes
are from AI and others are from the internet, while some are mine as
I refactor and learn more of this stuff.
